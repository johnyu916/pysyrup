Everything has initial values.
array = []
object = {}
number = 0
string = ""
bool = false

any variable within a function is accessible in the entire function, as long as it is set to some value first.

equality. == returns true if two JSON objects contain the same values.

There must be spaces between operations and operands. For example:

a - b
a + b
